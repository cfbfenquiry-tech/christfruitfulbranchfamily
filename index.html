        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Christ Fruitful Branch Family (CFBF) is a dynamic, Holy Spirit-led evangelism ministry and growing church family based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. We are an army of passionate believers on fire for Jesus, fully committed to fulfilling the Great Commission by rescuing the lost and making disciples in every sphere of society.</p>
        <p>Empowered by the Spirit, illuminated by His Light, and anchored in His unchanging Truth, we boldly take the Gospel to the darkest places: hospitals where the sick desperately need hope, prisons where captives long for true freedom, remote villages hungry for transformation, campuses ablaze with young hearts ready for revival, bustling streets and markets teeming with souls, and the vast digital world reaching millions online.</p>
        <p>Our outreaches are marked by supernatural miracles, healings, deliverances, and mass salvations as the power of God moves mightily. Lives are radically transformed, communities are impacted, and the Kingdom of God advances—one soul at a time.</p>
        <p>We are more than a ministry—we are a fruitful branch abiding in Christ (John 15:5), bearing eternal fruit that remains. Whether you're called to preach on the streets, pray for the sick, disciple new believers, or support the harvest through partnership, there's a place for you in this end-time army. Join us today and step into the greatest adventure: winning souls for eternity!</p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Spirit</h3>
                <p>At the heart of our ministry is an unyielding reliance on the Holy Spirit's power and guidance. As Jesus promised in Acts 1:8, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me." We are empowered by the Spirit for supernatural soul-winning, witnessing miracles, divine appointments, and bold proclamations that transform lives. Every outreach begins and ends with prayer, seeking the Spirit's leading to break chains, heal the brokenhearted, and draw souls into the Kingdom. Join us in experiencing the dynamic, life-changing force of the Holy Spirit in action!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>We are called to be the light of the world, as declared in Matthew 5:14-16: "You are the light of the world... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven." In a world shrouded in darkness—despair, sin, and hopelessness—CFBF shines Christ's radiant hope into every corner. Through compassionate acts, unwavering faith, and joyful service, we illuminate paths to salvation in hospitals, prisons, villages, campuses, streets, and online. Our light dispels fear, brings healing, and ignites eternal flames in hearts. Step into the brilliance and become a beacon of God's love today!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Truth</h3>
                <p>Anchored in the unchanging Word of God, we boldly proclaim the truth that sets people free, as Jesus said in John 8:32: "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." In an age of confusion and relativism, CFBF stands firm on biblical truth, sharing the Gospel without compromise. Our messages cut through deception, revealing God's redemptive plan, the reality of sin, and the victory of the cross. This truth empowers believers, convicts the lost, and builds unshakeable faith. Experience the liberating power of God's eternal truth and join us in declaring it to a world in need!</p>
